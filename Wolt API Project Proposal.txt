Project Proposal: Takeout Food Assistant Using Wolt API
1. Project Title:
Takeout Food Roulette Using Wolt API
2. Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to leverage the Wolt API in order  to enhance the takeout food ordering experience. The application will provide the user with a specific restaurant to order from, eliminating the need for the user to decide what to eat. All the user needs to do is input a location, and an optional “preference” (ie, dietary restriction), and the application replies with a restaurant that is available to order from.
3. Scope:
The project will focus on the following core features:
* Restaurant Discovery: Display a nearby restaurant using location-based data from the Wolt API.
* Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to  use specific criteria to filter results
* 4. Features:
* User Input:
   * Location input (manual entry or automatic detection)
   * Filtering options (e.g., food type, price range)
* Data Fetching:
   * Use the Wolt API to retrieve restaurant data in real-time.
* Recommendation:
   * Suggest restaurants based on criteria like high ratings and quick delivery times, while also retaining a level of randomness.
* 5. Technical Details:
* API: Wolt API (https://restaurant-api.wolt.com/v1/pages/restaurants)
* Libraries required: requests, tkinter (for GUI, optional)
6. Potential Challenges:
* Ease of use between user and api
* Compatibility between user-friendly city names and API input
* Ensuring availability of restaurant
